# Midterm Project

### Description of the problem
 I wanted to focus on a side of the tour de france that is rare, which is when athletes DNF. 
 I will use historic tour de france dataset to try to predict if individuals will continue and finish the tour or stage or not.

### How to run the project
The project is written on uv, so you should be able to uv run any of the scripts and it will build the project, and run the script in an
isolated environment.
